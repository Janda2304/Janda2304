Hello I'm a 15 year old High school student interested in game development and robotics.

I'm currently learning with c# and c/c++

Currently a student at a czech high school called "ssp≈°"

My current projects are a 2D roguelike/roguelite game called Romardia Tales and a simple text game to reinforce my c# basics
