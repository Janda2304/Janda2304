Hello I'm a 15 year old IT student currently studying at a czech high school called "ssp≈°"

I'm interested in game development, robotics and 3d printing (in general all modern technologies)

I know C# and C/C++ but i'm mainly using C# for all of my coding work

Currently my main project is a 2D roguelike/roguelite game called Romardia Tales which is currently in super early phases of development
