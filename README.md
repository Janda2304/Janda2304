### Something about me  

I'm a 15 year old Computer Science student currently studying at a czech high school called "ssp≈°"

I'm interested in game development, robotics and 3d printing (in general all modern technologies)

I know C, C++, C# and ZenScript but i'm mainly using C# for all of my coding work



### My Projects
Currently my main project is a 2D roguelike/roguelite game called Romardia Tales which is currently in super early phases of development

I'm also working on a minecraft modpack called Lost in Ages
