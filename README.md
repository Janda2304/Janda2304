Hello I'm a 15 year old High school student interested in game development and robotics.

I'm currently learning with c# and c/c++

Currently a student at a czech high school called "ssp≈°"

My main project is a 2D roguelike/roguelite game called Romardia Tales which is currently in super early phases of development
My secondary project is a simple text game to repeat some basics of C#
